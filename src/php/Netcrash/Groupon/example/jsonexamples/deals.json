Outsource an unpleasant task with today's Groupon: for $29, you get 12 months of online meal planning from <a href=\"http://e-mealz.com/\">E-Mealz</a> (a $58 value).</p>\n\n<p>Endorsed by financial author <a href=\"http://e-mealz.com/dave-ramsey\">Dave Ramsey</a> and highlighted on <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/blogs/Please-Tell-Me-What-to-Cook-Meal-Plan-Subscription-Services\">Oprah Winfrey's Life Lift blog</a>, E-Mealz charts out a week's worth of dollar- and healthy-savvy dinner recipes to relieve the burden of kitchen-related stress. Each week, organized grocery lists\u2014customized by family size, dietary desires, and store preferences\u2014showcase flavorful culinary creations for discerning palates. Plans developed by working parents capitalize on sale items at stores such as Wal-Mart and Kroger, and an \"any store\" list can be used to navigate the aisles of other favored grocers. Family meal plans serve seven meals for three to six people, whereas plans for two are tailored to singles, couples, or a pair of sock puppets on a date atop a chest of drawers.</p>\n\n<p>Special vegetarian, gluten-free, low-carb, low-fat, and portion-controlled <a href=\"https://e-mealz.com/meal-plans\">meal-plan options</a> aid nongeneric eaters in assembling targets for their teeth and postholiday fitness regimens. The Wal-Mart family plan supplies culinary sustenance to families of three to six for an average weekly cost of $75\u2013$85 and takes advantage of the store's regularly discounted prices. A duo can fill a Publix cart for $35\u2013$45 a week, including side dishes.</p>\n\n<p>Born of founder <a href=\"http://e-mealz.com/about\">Jane DeLaney's</a> desire to feed her family stress-free dinners provisioned from an organized list without coupons, E-Mealz allows shoppers to spend more time at the table and less time wandering about the grocery store uttering monophonic 10th-century chants in dismay.</p>","division":{"timezone":"Eastern Time (US & Canada)","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-18000,"name":"Youngstown","id":"youngstown","lng":-80.6495,"lat":41.0998},"dealTypes":[],"areas":[],"largeImageUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/site_images/1972/4225/E-Mealz-2_medium.jpg","id":"emealz-youngstown","says":{"emailContent":"Are all curses actually just remedies for hubris?","title":"The Groupon Guide to: Motivational Mottos","websiteContentHtml":"<p>Whether you're feeling so low that you're down in the dumps or feeling so sensational that you're up in the dumps, you'll feel better after repeating a motivational mantra to yourself.

Located on the Niagara River, just about 6 miles from Niagara Falls, the newly built, Federal-style hotel pays homage to the area's storied past while embracing contemporary comforts.</p>\n\n<p>Stately columns and Greek Revival furniture lend an elegant feel to the hotel's great room. The <a href=\"http://gr.pn/l2lWYJ\">guest rooms</a> blend together antique and modern elements, such as poster beds, gas fireplaces, iPod docking stations, and a spinning jenny with USB inputs. The Riverview Retreat rooms overlook the Niagara River. Each morning, guests can make their way to the hotel banquet room to enjoy a continental breakfast spread that includes eggs, sausage, bacon, and hash browns.</p>\n\n<p>Flowing curtains and soothing earth tones help usher in a tranquil atmosphere at the <a href=\"http://www.bartonhillhotel.com/spa/\">Spa at Barton Hill</a>. In the spa, specialists will pamper visitors with anything from a classic Swedish massage ($80 for 50 minutes) and manicure ($25) to an exotic Black Baltic mud wrap ($90 for 50 minutes). The $25 credit included in this deal may be used either at the spa or for dinner at the in-house Chantry Restaurant, where an experienced chef prepares gourmet cuisine such as homestyle beef stew and pan-seared tilapia.</p>\n\n<h4>Lewiston, New York: Historical Streets Minutes from Niagara Falls and Wineries</h4>\n\n<p>Lewiston was one of western New York's earliest settlements, dating back to the 1600s. Today, its quaint streets are lined with antique stores and art galleries. One can learn about America's early years at historical sites throughout the region, including <a href=\"http://oldfortniagara.org/\">Old Fort Niagara</a>, which stands atop a bluff overlooking Lake Ontario about 6 miles north of the hotel. The famous French and Indian War site is now a state park that conducts reenactments and features a museum lined with engaging exhibits and military artifacts.</p>\n\n<p>The majestic Niagara Falls resides about 10 minutes south of the hotel. Each second, 600,000 gallons of water cascade over the brink, sending a cool mist into the air; come winter, this mist frosts the evergreen trees in the <a href=\"http://www.niagarafallsstatepark.com/\">Niagara Falls State Park</a>, transforming the area into a real-life Fortress of Solitude.</p>\n\n<p>Barton Hill Hotel can set up guests on winery tours on the Niagara Wine Trail, which resides just about a 10-minute drive away.

But when the chris-crafts are stored for the winter and the beach volleyball nets come down, there's still no shortage of activity around Lake Geneva. Ice skaters crisscross public rinks, downhill skiers take to the slopes, and snowmobiles cut through the woods and across the frozen lakes, where ice fishers land walleye and northern pike. The Lake Geneva area thrives as a year-round mecca for outdoor adventure, catered by rustic-style luxury properties such as The Lodge at Geneva Ridge. Overlooking neighboring Lake Como, the lodge offers seclusion a few minutes' walk from Geneva Lake's north shore.</p>\n\n<p>The Lodge at Geneva Ridge's lakefront vistas are best appreciated at the onsite <a href=\"http://gr.pn/wTNv5c\">Lakeview Grille</a>, where wall-to-wall picture windows frame wooded slopes and the shores of Lake Como. In the kitchen, chefs hand-carve rib eyes, fillets, and prime ribs and prepare Friday-night fish fry ($10.95/person). Next door, the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/xy2w3j\">Lakeview Lounge</a> offers equally impressive vistas in a lodge setting with a stacked stone fireplace and an oak bar with a brass runner, where bartenders mix specialty cocktails tailored to each patron's id. </p>\n\n<p>Upstairs, <a href=\"http://gr.pn/w0SYWG\">resort-side king or two-queen rooms</a> carry on the lodge atmosphere with mission-style wood furnishings. Despite the rustic touches, a stay at The Lodge at Geneva Ridge hardly means roughing it. Specialists at the onsite <a href=\"http://gr.pn/zQSTOr\">spa and salon</a> draw from Swedish, Native American, Indian, and Japanese therapeutic traditions to craft a full range of massages and skin treatments, and a sauna and steam room chase away any winter chill. </p>\n\n<h4>Lake Geneva, Wisconsin: Winter Sports and Historical Museums</h4>\n\n<p>Winters in Lake Geneva are decidedly quieter than summers, and in addition to a host of outdoor activities, winter brings with it the benefit of smaller crowds. Snowshoers and cross-country skiers trek through ice-frosted bare groves along the <a href=\"http://gr.pn/ooquYT\">Geneva Lake Shore Path</a>, and ice fishers set up colorful shanties on the lake's frozen surface. Snowmobilers also careen along county trails, and March 16\u201318 brings the grand finale of the Amsoil Championship Snocross Series to town as professionals soar over elevated jumps and blindfolded snowmen. </p>\n\n<p>There's also plenty for families to do indoors. The <a href=\"http://www.genevalakemuseum.org/\">Geneva Lake Museum</a> takes visitors back in time with re-created 19th-century shops, and the 1897-era <a href=\"http://gr.pn/xDhege\">Yerkes Observatory</a> holds the world's largest refracting telescope, which has the capability of reading the bottom line of a Snellen chart pinned to moon.</p>","division":{"timezone":"Central Time (US & Canada)","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-21600,"name":"Milwaukee","id":"milwaukee","lng":-87.9065,"lat":43.0389},"dealTypes":[],"areas":[],"largeImageUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/site_images/1978/9004/The-Lodge-at-Geneva-Ridge_aerial-Primary_medium.jpg","id":"ga-m-the-lodge-at-geneva-ridge","says":{"emailContent":"","title":"","websiteContentHtml":"","emailContentHtml":"","id":"groupon-says-35972539","websiteContent":""},"options":[{"maximumPurchaseQuantity":4,"customFields":[{"type":"other","label":"Full Name of the Person who will Redeem the Groupon","required":true}],"soldQuantity":580,"discountPercent":44,"discount":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":7100,"formattedAmount":"$71.00"},"soldQuantityMessage":"580+","externalUrl":null,"expiresAt":"2012-05-26T04:59:00Z","value":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":16000,"formattedAmount":"$160.00"},"price":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":8900,"formattedAmount":"$89.00"},"title":"1-Night Stay for Up to Four in a Resort-Side King or Two-Queen Room","details":[{"description":"Must travel by 5/25/12.

Out front, desert brush borders a lagoon filled with swans and colorful koi fish, and the Sacramento River flows by just steps away. Gaia's commitment to eco-friendly practices is evident throughout the hotel. Natural spa treatments incorporate herbs and elderberries grown onsite, and tubular skylights help to save energy by diffusing sunlight throughout the interior. </p>\n\n<p>Guest rooms are decorated in neutral earth tones, and picture windows afford ample views of the Sacramento River and surrounding woodlands. Outdoors, a relaxing whirlpool spa is purified using natural saline instead of chlorine or other chemicals. The onsite <a href=\"http://www.gaiashasta.com/lotusspamenu.asp\">Lotus Spa</a> offers invigorating body wraps and hot-stone massages for weary backs or stressed-out pet rocks.  </p>\n\n<p>At the hotel's restaurant, <a href=\"http://www.gaiashasta.com/dining.asp\">Woodside Grill</a>, chef Gregory McChristian prepares Cajun chicken fettuccine ($14) and hand-cut Woodside fillet ($28) culled from ranches in the area. Breakfast options include french toast ($8) made with a rustic baguette. Adhering to Gaia's earth-friendly, socially conscious mission, the eatery composts leftovers and regularly donates food to local families in need. </p>\n\n<h4>Anderson, California: Quiet Town Amid Sacramento Valley's Natural Grandeur</h4>\n\n<p>Situated along the Sacramento River in northern California's Sacramento Valley, Anderson is an ideal outpost for exploring nearby lakes, waterfalls, and backcountry trails. Kayaking and whitewater rafting are popular on the river, and skiers flock to Mount Shasta, located about an hour's drive away. Closer to Anderson, the bustling city of Redding boasts authentic Mexican restaurants, historical museums, and Sundial Bridge, which spans the river and rivals Andre the Giant's wristwatch as one of the world's largest timepieces.  </p>","division":{"timezone":"Pacific Time (US & Canada)","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-28800,"name":"Sacramento","id":"sacramento","lng":-121.494,"lat":38.5816},"dealTypes":[{"name":"Lighter Footprint","id":"lighter-footprint"}],"areas":[],"largeImageUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/site_images/1978/7652/Gaia-Shasta-Hotel_Primary_medium.jpg","id":"ga-m-gaia-shasta-hotel","says":{"emailContent":"","title":"","websiteContentHtml":"","emailContentHtml":"","id":"groupon-says-40341923-100001733","websiteContent":""},"options":[{"maximumPurchaseQuantity":4,"customFields":[],"soldQuantity":60,"discountPercent":46,"discount":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":6400,"formattedAmount":"$64.00"},"soldQuantityMessage":"60+","externalUrl":null,"expiresAt":"2012-05-30T06:59:00Z","value":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":13900,"formattedAmount":"$139.00"},"price":{"currencyCode":"USD","amount":7500,"formattedAmount":"$75.00"},"title":"1-Night Stay for Up to Four in a Standard King or Double-Queen Room","details":[{"description":"Must complete travel by 5/29/12.
